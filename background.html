     <H1>BACKGROUND INFORMATION</H1>
     <P>My parents grew up near each other. My mother's family (The Mazariegos)
        lived in Palestina de Los ALtos, Guatemala while my father's family lived
        in a neighborhood outside of Palesina called Los Laurelles.Their families
        were close and my mother was close friends with my father's sisters. However, my mom hated my dad. She thought he was full of himself. They both went their separate ways after middle school but met again when they were 21 in the U.S. My dad lived in San Rafael while my mom lived in Los Angeles but my dad went to LA to visit family. He saw my mom again at a party and they both fell in love. They got married when they were 23 and my Mom left LA to live with my dad in San Rafael. Two years later, they had their first child, me.</P>
      <P>I was an only child for four years before my mother had another baby; a baby boy named Daniel. A year later, she had another baby named Justin. For 8 years we grew up together and became very close. We believed that we were going to be the three musketeers but then a surprise came along.</P>
      <P>Our baby brother, Anthony, was born in 2015. He was practically the special baby in the house, dethroning Justin.</P>
