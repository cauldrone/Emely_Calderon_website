     <H2>Family Story</H2>
     <P>My parents grew up near each other. My mother's family (The Mazariegos)
        lived in Palestina de Los Altos, Guatemala while my father's family lived
        in a neighborhood outside of Palesina called Los Laurelles.Their families
        were close and my mother was close friends with my father's sisters. However, my mom hated my dad. She thought he was full of himself. They both went their separate ways after middle school but met again when they were 21 in the U.S. My dad lived in San Rafael while my mom lived in Los Angeles but my dad went to LA to visit family. He saw my mom again at a party and they both fell in love. They got married when they were 23 and my Mom left LA to live with my dad in San Rafael. Two years later, they had their first child, me.</P>
      <P>I was an only child for four years before my mother had another baby; a baby boy named Daniel. A year later, she had another baby named Justin. For 8 years we grew up together and became very close. We believed that we were going to be the three musketeers but then a surprise came along.</P>
      <P>Our baby brother, Anthony, was born in 2015. He was practically the special baby in the house, dethroning Justin.</P>
      <H2>Places I've Lived In</H2>
      <P>I was born in Greenbrae but lived in San Rafael during my first 2 and a half years of life. Afterwards, my parents bought a house in Vallejo after realizing that our family was growing. We moved to Vallejo where we stayed for 6 years. However, my father still worked in San Rafael which meant that he would leave early in the morning to beat traffic and return late at night. My mother did not like this so she decided that we move back to San Rafael. The summer before eighth grade, we returned to San Rafael and I transferred to a new school.</P>
      <H2>Story time</H2>
      <P>I love my brothers dearly and as the oldest, I take it upon myself to take care of them and keep them safe. One memorable story that I can share is the story of how I saved Justin from getting a burn. I was 6 and he was 1. We were in our living room on the couch. I had ofered to feed him yogurt while my mother cooked dinner in the kitchen. I was determined to feed him and not drop yogurt on the couch so I took the task very seriously. Justin was calm but he would move ever so often so I got nervous. It was a new couch and it would be terrible if we spilled some yogurt. Anyways, at some point, Justin lost interest in the yogurt and started crawling to the side of the couch. He was looking over the edge at something. I was confused but then I noticed the smoke. Without thinking, I pulled him back, hugging him to my body. Out of nowhere, a flame shot up, right where Justin's face was. The nearby curtain caught the flames as well. I began screaming for my mother while holding the terrified baby. She ran in and could not believe her eyes. I do not know how she extinguished the fire as I was busy calming down Justin. I just heard her mentioning that it was the extension cord. When she was done, she hugged my brother and me and didn't let go. My dad and other brother came home from the grocery store and saw my mother sobbing as she held Justin and I. The curtains were thrown as they were burnt and dad examined the extension cord. But worst of all, ... I had spilt the yogurt on the new sofa. </P>
